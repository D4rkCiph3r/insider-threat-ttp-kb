# Insider Threat TTP Knowledgebase
The principal objective of this project is to develop a knowledge base of the tactics, techniques, and procedures 
(TTPs)used by insiders in the IT environment. It will establish an Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base, built upon
data collected on insider threat incidents and lessons learned and experience from the ATT&CK knowledge base.
